The Winbond SPI flash used in REV-A (w25q128jv) is not one supported by Vivado (as of 2019.2) so openocd is used to program the flash instead.

This binary was made using the openocd generator in contrib/loaders/flash/fpga/xilinx_bscan_spi.py with the patch applied in order to have the correct pinout.

Flash programmed via openocd's jtagspi driver using the indirect JTAG to SPI bitstream. The openocd.cfg file is configured for raspberry pi.

Openocd built from source commit d88765a7e2997c987ea7e5391378b3ae8b4fb59b (git://git.code.sf.net/p/openocd/code) with:

./configure --enable-bcm2835gpio
make -j3
sudo make install

Command to flash:

sudo openocd -f openocd.cfg -c "init; jtagspi_init 0 bscan_spi_xc7a35t.bit; jtagspi_program L1S32.bin 0x0"
